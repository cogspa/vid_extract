hello guys welcome back to the channel
0:01
today we will look at how to create a
0:03
simple looking animation in figma let's
0:06
get started
0:08
the first step is to create a frame so
0:11
when you create a frame you set the
0:13
dimensions to the width once we see and
0:16
the heights of 11 pixels
0:22
[Music]
0:26
next step is to change the color of the
0:29
frame
0:31
[Music]
0:33
using the keyboard combination Ctrl D
0:36
you can repeat it and free
0:39
[Music]
0:41
where do I go
0:44
you can choose to set ingredients value
0:47
for free too

[Applause]
1:14
select both frames and set the radials
1:18
to 200 pixels
1:20
[Music]
1:37
drug and place Frame 2 on top of frame
1:40
one and align them perfectly afterwards
1:43
group the selection of duplicates
1:48
foreign
1:52
[Music]
1:55
from the layers panel and select the
1:59
message screen to inside the frame one
2:02
now carefully drag the color gradients
2:04
to the left
2:11
select both frames and create a
2:13
component set
2:20
switch to prototype mode and sets the
2:23
trigger to factor delete
2:25
the timer 800 milliseconds then also
2:29
sets animation to slot and links on
2:31
timer 300 milliseconds
2:35
[Music]
2:46
copy and paste the first element in your
2:49
component sets onto your new frame
2:52
[Music]
3:04
in order to achieve that smooth
3:06
transition use the ellipse tool to
3:09
create a circle on your logo and set
3:12
color to white
3:13
foreign

[Music]

[Applause]
3:19
[Music]
3:34
[Applause]
3:36
[Music]
3:45
switch to prototype mode and set trigger
3:48
to after delay
3:50
then set the timer 2600 milliseconds
3:54
also 6 animation to Smart animes with
3:57
timer at 300 milliseconds
4:05
repeat the same process for the next
4:07
frame but set after delay to 800
4:10
milliseconds
